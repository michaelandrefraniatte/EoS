                <p>
                    <b>W</b>ith the equations in this program, coming from Soave-Redlich-Kwong, some other very old authors and me, in 2009, I modelized and then synthetized, for the first time, in a little hydrothermal system, reproducing gas generation (as I was a student in a laboratory working on Origin of Life, but alone to work on my PhD), in pure quantity, and at 250°C and 140 bars, the molecule of Origin Of Life: The Acridine Orange. It's the organic molecule where any other can be derived. It increases Lifetime and is able to generate ADN, because it can replicate. I synthetised a lot of pure molecules from easy calculation with this program. It found statistic volume of atmosphere and ocean like on Earth. It prooves that ice on Mars have something under totally different than ice and in big quantities like an atmosphere. I applied perfectly calculations, and from original equations, I made only 2 changes, empirically and theorically prooven from very old authors and my works with a new mathematical hypothesis I found. I was able to resolve derivation of all polynomial equations, resolve all polynomial equations with a hand pen, all differential equations better than with CNP functions which is a wrong method, all eletrochemical potentials, define all diffusion coefficients of materials from diffusion profil, find the properties of 2 unknown constituents, all PVTX data, PT traject of all fluid inclusions, solubilities of all constituents in all fluids, proove the equality of pressures from each side of a membrane, proove that any molecule pure in a closed system are stabilized at any temperature and any pressure, resolve all chemical reactions, synthetise easy any molecules and find all properties of molecules from my modelizations, but scientific community screamed on me and my own knowledges, and then pushed me out. Instead of pay me, they printed on papers all my researches, the last day I was in the laboratory, and some mounths later, they asked my PC password. But they are unable to understand and continue whatever. The slightest thing that disappeared in the laboratory, I was accused of stealing it. No helps, only screams. I had to become homeless and foodless without my parents. In 2009, my contribution was to make working Equation of State method for all PVTX data and chemical Reactions, with experimental proofs, and in all environements without any fake idea, after 50 years of copy/paste wrong articles without any interest, if I did not do that. Even this said, actually nobody made better in anything concenring EoS, and it's not recognized in any manner by scientific community totally dropped, otherwise I would know it, in first place.

                    <b>T</b>he data for PVT and PVTX, on NIST, in scientific articles on pure gases, and on mixtures, often mixed for constituents in same mixture are either a volume of gas per mole of gas, or a volume of liquid and gas per mole of gas, or a volume of liquid and gas per mole of liquid and gas. It need to search proofs among the experimental protocoles, but it can be found easy with my modelization where I applied perfectly EoS and changed only 2 equations from original of Soave-Redlich-Kwong. It's very accurate and established chemical reaction data for stabilize and synthetize any molecule. If I could publish, I would make an article: An Improved Redlich-Kwong-Soave Equation of State for Defining and Correlating All PVT-PVTX Data. I would decline it with other EoS types, like with Peng-Robinson EoS. I would also make another article on modelization of any molecule synthesis at high temperature and high pressure, with experimental examples. I would also make an article on why you can't measure fugacity coefficients, and why it's only possible by studying reactions. And other articles on Earth, and Mars with their athmospheres and soils in terms of constituent volumes and quantities from sonde measures and my model. But also one article on two unknown constituents I can proove the existence.

                    <b>I</b>'ve published in 2008 an article on the stability of Adenine at 300°C and normally 500 bar. In 2009, after calculations, I've synthetized Acridine Orange at 250°C and normally 140 bar. It's the same experiment, only temperature changed and it's water instead of water and aqueous Adenine. I'm interested to publish my works in an article. I also have lot of ideas for publish other works around my modelization. It's normal the author I am on it, I can publish myself my works on it. It's not normal to scream on my works, and to print my works, the day I was fired leaving the laboratory I was, without any good reason, by a research director. The worst in it, is that I've never been paid, only with screams and accusations.

                    <b>I</b>'ve had fun with several CSV files coming with the program. I've had fun to modelize and synthetize everything, had fun to discover responses to the unviversal Universe, just thinking that in a closed system (which is open on itselve), gas molecules and liquid molecules are in same number for a given constituent, so the system itselve is half gas and half liquid, and gas can be more dense than liquid. The program is illustrating with the following 4 pictures, where Acridine Orange synthesis is taken in example. Let's see...

                <p>
                    <b>S</b>cientific community believes to equality of chemical potentials from each edge of a membrane. Hydrogen diffusion through a membrane for 10 bars, mixing with argon at 500 bars, make increase the total pressure to 513 bars because for them hydrogen have a fugacity coefficient of 1.3. But everyone can understand that argon has less space making argon to be at 503 bars. From each edge of a membrane it's the equality of pressures, not of fugacities as they thinking. If it was the equality of fugacities why hydrogen alone in the system would not be at 13 bars? Very old authors are all dead, and people think only new and all new articles are true, old are wrong. What I made and found are theorically, experimentally, and empirically prooven, and modelize the entire matter in the Universe. I made the web version of <a href="../EoSResol-Web-Application/">EoSResol</a>. <a target="_blank" href="EquationOfStateResolution.pdf">This</a> is my book about the equations, <a target="_blank" href="ProgramingEoSResol.pdf">this</a> is my book about the WinForms, <a target="_blank" href="ExcelEoSResol.pdf">this</a> is my book about the XLS, <a href="EoSResolXLS.xls" download class="dl-link">this</a> is my XLS file with macros, and I made example CSV files to open with the web version. And I also made the Windows Store program that was published but fired. To note, it need to set dot instead of comma for number floating as decimal separator in regional options, under control panel. My source codes and program are <a href="https://github.com/michaelandrefraniatte/EoS">here</a>.

                    <b>T</b>he director of the laboratory I was, think of gas and liquid phasis above and under liquid-vapor curve, but it's like electrochemical potentials, the curve is calculated from the equilibrium, i.e. when it's equal. He fired my chief, whom was my professor, in University during curses and stages. He also accused me that I wasn't coming but they didn't paid me, so I was working half at home, and half in the laboratory. For them, spontaneous generation of molecules and computing equilibration of reaction are impossible. I did it but nobody contact me, I'm asking why all day long. It's kind of jealousy instead of want to contribute, jealousy pushing to take the place, but it's too high for them. They destroyed a 1 000 0000 bucks machine (ESI Mass Spectrometer) for I don't have the spectrum of Acridine Orange, mocked me that it was not it when I was able to analyse the residual minerals after 1 months, but obviously, bacteria replaced all, in 2 weeks. They also destroyed another expensive experimental machine I was working for I found diffusion coefficients of hydrogen for validation to make other experiments on Origin of Life. Both broken by the same guy.
